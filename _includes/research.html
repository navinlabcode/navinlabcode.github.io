                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Our laboratory has pioneered the development of single cell sequencing technologies.  We apply these tools to study complex biological processes that occur in human cancers including tumor initation, clonal evolution, invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance.  These processes have previously been difficult to study with genomic technologies using bulk tissues.We are actively developing novel computational and statistical methods for analyzing large-scale single cell DNA and RNA sequencing datasets.  Our primary focus is on breast cancer patients.  At MD Anderson we are uniquely positioned to translate our single cell sequencing methods into the clinic, to improve early detection, non-invasive monitoring, diagnostics and guiding targeted therapy. These clinical applications are expected to have a major impact on reducing morbidity in cancer patients and improving their quality of life.<br／><br／><br／><br／></h3>
